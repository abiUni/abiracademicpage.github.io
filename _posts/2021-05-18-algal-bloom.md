Here you can research and explain the phenomenon 
Most importantly you should explain to the general public how this affects them (toxic)

You can start like this:
I first learned about this phenomenen in .... class. Back then I didn't give it much thought.
Then news kept coming in of people seeing a fluorescent green substance in the water at night.
Naturally it fascinated many and pictures of sightings flooded social media accounts.
The frenzy actually helped raise awareness about the state of many beaches of the Mediterranean.
This may have been a new phenomenon to many in Tunisia, but it has been sighted in other countries
such as Greece, Italy and Egypt as early as the 1980s.... (such a suggestion)
